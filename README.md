# Face Recognition
Face Recognition in a Screen Recorder (Live) using threads.
First of all we are taking pictures of our/others faces with face detection,
Then we training our model for each face and classifying them by indexes,
And then we can recognize familiar faces while using live apps like:
Zoom, meet, etc.
